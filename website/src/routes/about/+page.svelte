			<p>Hey!</p>
			<p>
				We're Aaron and John. Thanks to Bitcoin, we're not just excited about the future â€“ we're on
				a mission to shape it. Inspired by the optimism and talent found in this community, we
				decided to use our skills to build Clams. Why stop at having the best money? We also need
				the best tools to help Bitcoiners manage their finances in a self-sovereign way. We are
				committed to keeping the app accessible to as many people as possible, which is why our core
				features will always be free. To ensure the long-term sustainability and continuous
				improvement of Clams, we're exploring options for a paid version. More details on that soon.
				We are our first customers, and we hope you will join us.
			</p>
			<p>Cheers,</p>
			<p>Aaron & John</p>
