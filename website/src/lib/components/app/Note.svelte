		<h2 class="">Hey!</h2>
		<h2>
			We're Aaron and John, a couple of musicians turned software engineers who took the orange
			pill, and like so many others, we couldn't think of anything else. Thanks to Bitcoin, we're
			not just excited about the future â€“ we're on a mission to shape it.
		</h2>
		<h2>
			Inspired by the optimism and talent found in this community, we decided to use our skills to
			build Clams. Why stop at having the best money? We also need the best tools to help Bitcoiners
			manage their finances in a self-sovereign way.
		</h2>
		<h2>
			We are committed to keeping the app accessible to as many people as possible, which is why our
			core features will always be free. To ensure the long-term sustainability and continuous
			improvement of Clams, we're exploring options for paid add-on services. By choosing these
			premium offerings, you'll not only support the project but also unlock even more powerful
			tools to bring you closer to life on a Bitcoin Standard. More details on that <a

		<h2 class="">We are our first customers, and we hope you will join us.</h2>
		<h2 class="">Cheers, Aaron & John</h2>
