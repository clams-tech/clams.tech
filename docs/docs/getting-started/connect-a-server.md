# Connect a Server (Optional)

This step allows you to choose which server Clams will use to query balances for your onchain wallets.

You have three options:
1. Connect to your own Electrum or Eslora server
2. Use a public server
3. Skip this step and use the default Clams server

Your choice affects the privacy of your wallet data. We recommend using your own server for maximum privacy, but the Clams server is a convenient alternative.
