# Connect a Wallet

For the final step, let's connect your first Bitcoin wallet to Clams. We'll use an onchain wallet as our example.

To connect your wallet, you'll need its xpub (extended public key). Here's how to get it from Sparrow Wallet:

1. Open Sparrow Wallet
2. Navigate to the Settings tab for your wallet
3. Double-click on the xpub to copy it to your clipboard

Next, in Clams:
1. Paste the xpub in the designated field
2. Select the address types you want to scan for (if unsure, select all options)
3. Click "Connect Wallet" to proceed

Pro tip: Check the addresses in Sparrow to quickly identify which address types you're actually using.

Once you've added the wallet, Clams will begin syncing. Shortly, your wallet balance and transaction history will appear on your dashboard.
