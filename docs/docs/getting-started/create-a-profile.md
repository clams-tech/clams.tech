# Create a Profile

When you first open Clams, you'll be prompted to create a profile. Profiles help you organize wallets and their associated transactions into logical groups.

Let's create a profile named "Alice" to start:
1. Enter "Alice" in the profile name field
2. Click "Create Profile" to continue

@TODO insert screenshot of initial profile creation during setup
