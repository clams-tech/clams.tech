## What are Filters?
Filters help you narrow down your transaction history based on specific criteria, allowing you to focus on exactly the information you need. This feature makes it easier to analyze your financial data and find specific transactions.

## Filter Types

### Date Filters
Narrow down transactions to specific time periods:
- Select specific months or years
- View transactions within custom date ranges
- Focus on specific financial quarters

- Specific detailed accounts (e.g., "Expenses:Fees:Lightning")
