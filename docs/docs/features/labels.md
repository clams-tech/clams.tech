# Labels

## What are Labels?
Labels help you organize and categorize your transactions in Clams. While the system automatically detects and labels many transaction types, you can customize these labels to better reflect your financial organization.

## Automatic Labeling
Clams intelligently identifies transaction types, such as:
- Transfers between connected wallets
- Incoming and outgoing payments
- Fee transactions

The more wallets you connect to Clams, the more accurate these automatic labels become.

## Managing Labels

### Adding Custom Labels
1. Click on any transaction in your history
2. In the transaction details modal, locate the labeling section
3. Add tags, notes, or change the category as needed
4. Save your changes

### Categorizing Transactions
You can assign transactions to specific categories:
- Recategorize expenses (e.g., "Groceries", "Entertainment")
- Create custom categories for income sources (e.g., "Tips", "Freelance Work")
- Organize transfers between your own wallets
