# Backups

## Overview
The Backups feature allows you to create and restore copies of your Clams data, including your connections, labels, tags, and customizations.

## Why Backups Matter
Clams stores all your data locally on your deviceâ€”we never store your information on our servers. This means regular backups are essential to prevent data loss if you:
- Switch to a new device
- Experience hardware failure
- Need to reinstall the application

## Creating a Backup

### Steps to Back Up Your Data
1. Navigate to the Settings section
2. Click on the Backup icon
3. Click the "Create Backup" button
4. Choose a location to save your backup file

### What Gets Backed Up
- Wallet connections
- Custom labels and tags
- Transaction categorizations
- Application preferences

### Backup Frequency
We recommend creating backups:
- After adding new wallets
- After significant categorization work
- Before upgrading the application
- On a regular schedule (monthly)

## Restoring from a Backup

### Steps to Restore Your Data
1. Navigate to the Settings section
2. Click on the Backup icon
3. Click on the restore area or drag your backup file into the designated zone
4. Confirm that you want to restore from this backup

### Important Notes
- Restoring from a backup will replace your current data
- Make sure your backup file is not corrupted before restoring
- Keep multiple backups in different locations for added security
