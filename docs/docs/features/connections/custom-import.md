# Custom Import Connection

## Overview
The Custom Import feature is our catch-all solution for importing transaction data from sources that aren't covered by our standard connections. This feature allows you to upload CSV files containing transaction data you want Clams to track.

## Use Cases
- Exchange transaction history
- Data from unsupported wallets
- Custom transaction records

## Connection Steps

### 1. Prepare Your CSV File
Ensure your CSV file contains the necessary transaction data in the correct format.

### 2. Import to Clams
1. In Clams, navigate to the Connections section
2. Select "Custom Import"
3. Upload your CSV file
4. Follow the interface prompts to map columns if needed

### 3. Review and Confirm
The interface will guide you through the import process:
- It will notify you of any missing columns
- It will alert you if the format needs adjustment
- It will provide a preview of the data to be imported

## Notes
- The intelligent import system helps ensure your data is correctly formatted
- You can import data from multiple sources using separate imports
- This is especially useful for exchanges, as direct exchange connections are limited at this time
