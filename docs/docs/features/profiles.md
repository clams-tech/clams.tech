# Profiles

## What are Profiles?
Profiles help you separate different financial entities in Clams. Each profile maintains its own collection of wallets, transactions, and labels, allowing you to keep personal finances separate from business or family finances.

## Common Use Cases
- Personal and business wallet separation
- Managing finances for different family members
- Separating client portfolios

## Managing Profiles

### Creating a Profile
1. When first launching Clams, you'll be prompted to create your initial profile
2. To create additional profiles, click the profile menu in the top-right corner
3. Select "Add Profile" and enter a name for your new profile

## Important Considerations
Profiles are completely independent and do not share data. If you need to track transactions between different entities (such as gifts to family members), consider keeping those wallets under a single profile for automatic transfer detection.

## Examples
- **Personal Profile**: Your personal wallets, daily expenses, and savings
- **Business Profile**: Company funds, business expenses, and client payments
- **Client Profile**: A client at your accountancy firm.
