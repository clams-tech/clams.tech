### Background

It all started with a simple question: **_Can we live on a Bitcoin standard today?_**

To find out, we ran Lightning nodes for daily payments and paired them with services like [Bitrefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/). The challenges quickly became apparent: every spend triggered a taxable event, and accounting for complex scenarios‚Äîlike force-closed channels‚Äîturned into a logistical nightmare.

And that‚Äôs just Lightning. Like many Bitcoin holders, we have funds spread across various setups: single-sig, multi-sig, and mobile wallets. Meanwhile, new payment protocols like [Ark](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-ark-plans-to-scale-private-bitcoin-payments) and [Cashu](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/cashu-a-vision-for-a-bitcoin-powered-ecash-ecosystem), along with emerging economic models like [_Value for Value_](https://www.samara-ag.com/market-insights/value-for-value), are adding even more layers of complexity.

This abundance of options makes Bitcoin incredibly powerful‚Äîbut also increasingly difficult to track and manage.

The reality? Most Bitcoin holders avoid spending because tracking capital gains is tedious and time-consuming. For businesses, generating essential reports like profit and loss statements or cash flow analyses is even harder.

Bitcoin may be the best form of money, but it‚Äôs far from practical for everyday use.

### Current Landscape

When tax season arrived, we had no choice but to write custom scripts to convert our Lightning node data into a format compatible with existing accounting software. The process was technical, time-consuming, and required sharing sensitive financial data with third parties.

To our surprise, many Bitcoiners face the same struggle‚Äîspending weekends reconciling transactions every year. Hiring professionals isn‚Äôt much better: it‚Äôs expensive, manual, and still invasive.

While ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù accounting tools exist, they often fall short for Bitcoin holders. Most focus on simple on-chain transactions and overlook the complexities of protocols like Lightning. This left us wondering:

- How many Bitcoiners are held back by these same challenges?
- Could accounting be a hidden barrier to Bitcoin adoption?
- What if there were a platform that respected privacy and autonomy?

Today, there‚Äôs no Bitcoin-first solution that addresses these issues.
