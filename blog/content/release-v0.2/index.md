## Descriptor Connection

Descriptor wallets provide a simple way to describe complex script conditions like multisig wallets.

**Privacy Note:**
When fetching transactions for each address, we randomly select an Esplora instance from a list of public instances. For added privacy, use a VPN while syncing. In the future, you'll be able to define your own list of trusted instances (e.g., self-hosted).
