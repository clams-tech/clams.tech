#### Privacy by Design

Privacy is at the core of Clams. Our app is built to operate entirely on your device—just <a href="https://clams.tech/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download Clams</a> and connect your wallets. Your financial data stays with you, ensuring full control without relying on external servers. We don’t use Google scripts or any other tracking software.

#### Privacy-First Data Handling

We believe in transparency. In our <a href="https://clams.tech/#faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ</a>, we detail every API request the app makes so you can see exactly how we derive journal entries from your Bitcoin data. Our focus is on delivering a seamless, privacy-respecting experience without compromising usability.

As fellow Bitcoiners, we've built privacy-enhancing features directly into the app. When you connect an XPUB, it stays on your device. For address lookups, we distribute queries across multiple servers to avoid oversharing with any single entity. When fetching historical price data, we request a broad range to further preserve anonymity. For additional privacy, we recommend using a VPN when connecting to public Electrum servers.

#### Future Enhancements

We’re working on giving you even more control over how Clams fetches and processes your data. In the future, you'll have the flexibility to choose between using public servers, connecting your own, or utilizing the Clams server when available. Our goal is to provide options that balance convenience and privacy, allowing you to configure the app in a way that best suits your needs.

#### Software Development Philosophy

We’re strong supporters of open-source software—our work on <a href="https://github.com/clams-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> includes projects like <a href="https://remote.clams.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote</a>, our open-source CLN interface. For Clams, we’ve chosen a closed-source model for now, as it’s a read-only application with no spending permissions. We’ll continue to evaluate this decision as Clams grows.

#### Don't Trust, Verify

We encourage you to explore how Clams handles data. Here’s a short video demonstrating how you can independently verify all API calls made by the app:
