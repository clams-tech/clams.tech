## Exports Widget

We’re excited to introduce the first version of our brand-new **Exports Widget**. To start we have two export options:

1. **Capital Gains Report** – Generates a detailed CSV export of capital gains for all events within a selected date range. You can pick specific days or use preset options like _Year to Date_ and _Last Quarter_.
2. **Journal Entries Export** – A complete export of all journal entries, helping you verify your capital gains reports with raw transaction data.

For capital gains calculations, we support three algorithms:

- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**
- **HIFO (Highest In, First Out)**

This flexibility allows you to analyze different tax scenarios and optimize your reporting. Try different methods and see how they impact your return on investment calculations.

The **Journal Entries Export** includes the same date range filters and is particularly useful if you need a full record of transactions. This file may be especially helpful for accountants.

## V4V Modal

Some folks have asked how they can support the app with sats, so while we're still in beta, we're adopting a **Value for Value (V4V) model**.

We've added a **V4V Modal**, accessible via the button at the bottom of the app. You can support us via:

- **BOLT12**
- **LNURL**
- **Lightning Address**
- **On-chain Bitcoin payments**

All of our features will remain free during beta. Once we exit beta, we’ll introduce a yearly subscription, with a discount for beta testers.
